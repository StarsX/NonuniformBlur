   Do this:
      #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
   before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the implementation.

   // i.e. it should look like this:
   #include ...
   #include ...
   #include ...
   #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
   #include "stb_image.h"

   You can #define STBI_ASSERT(x) before the #include to avoid using assert.h.
   And #define STBI_MALLOC, STBI_REALLOC, and STBI_FREE to avoid using malloc,realloc,free


   QUICK NOTES:
      Primarily of interest to game developers and other people who can
          avoid problematic images and only need the trivial interface

      JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib)
      PNG 1/2/4/8/16-bit-per-channel

      TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
      BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
      PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)

      GIF (*comp always reports as 4-channel)
      HDR (radiance rgbE format)
      PIC (Softimage PIC)
      PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

      Animated GIF still needs a proper API, but here's one way to do it:
          http://gist.github.com/urraka/685d9a6340b26b830d49

      - decode from memory or through FILE (define STBI_NO_STDIO to remove code)
      - decode from arbitrary I/O callbacks
      - SIMD acceleration on x86/x64 (SSE2) and ARM (NEON)
